Installation of GPS Correlate
=============================
To build, you will need these prerequisites:

* The Exiv2 library (C++ EXIF tag handling): http://www.exiv2.org/
* libxml2 (XML parsing): http://www.xmlsoft.org/
* pkgconfig: https://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/
* make, such as GNU makes: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html
* GTK+ (only if compiling the GUI)s: http://www.gtk.org
* xsltproc (only for building the man page): http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/
  with manpages/docbook.xsl properly installed from
  http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/ or Internet access (xsltproc
  will download it automatically if it is not installed)

You can build the command line version and the GUI together simply with:
  make
and install it with:
  sudo make install
Run the regression test suite with:
  make check

The default build process will try to link against GTK2.
To force linking against GTK3 run:

  make GTK=3

If the compiler can't find the necessary libraries, then set the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the location of the .pc files first.

To build only the command-line tool without the GTK dependencies, do:
  make gpscorrelate
In both cases, pkg-config must be available to determine the compilation
arguments for libxml2 and exiv2.

gpscorrelate uses only standard features available in C99, POSIX and X/Open.
Some C environments may not provide all the necessary features, and some
environments may require compiling with the make command-line argument
CFLAGS='-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600' to enable them.
Alternately, you can compile gpscorrelate entirely with a C++ toolchain by
compiling with make CC='$(CXX)'

gpscorrelate comes translated into a number of languages, but support is not
enabled by default as the gettext function is not universally available.
To enable foreign language support, compile with
"make CFLAGS=-DENABLE_NLS" (and LIBS=-lintl if required) and use the
additional command "sudo make install-po" to install the message catalogs.
Note that GNU make is required for this step.
