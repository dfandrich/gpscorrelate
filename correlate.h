 *      Returns NULL for Point.
 * _TOOFAR - point outside "feather" time. Too far from any point.
 *      Returns NULL for Point.
 * _EXIFWRITEFAIL - unable to write EXIF tags.
 * _NOEXIFINPUT - The source file contained no EXIF tags, or not the one we wanted. Hmm.
 *      Returns NULL for Point.
 * _GPSDATAEXISTS - There is already GPS data in the photo... you probably don't want
 *      to fiddle with it.
