<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This manual page documents the <span class=
"command"><strong>gpscorrelate</strong></span> command. There is
extended documentation available in HTML format; see below.</p>
<p><span class="command"><strong>gpscorrelate</strong></span> is a
program that acts on digital images in JPEG format, filling in the
EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) fields related to GPS (Global
Positioning System) information. Source for the GPS data is a GPX
(GPS Exchange Format) file, which records GPS location information
in an XML-based format. The act of filling those fields is referred
to as <span class="emphasis"><em>correlation</em></span>.</p>
<p>If GPS data are available at the precise moment the image was
taken (with a 1-second granularity) the GPS data are stored
unmodified in EXIF fields. If they are not, linear interpolation of
GPS data available at moments before and after the image was taken
can be used. If the image contains sub-second time resolution, it
is used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the position between
the two points. Linear interpolation gives good results when points
are close together, but if they are several kilometres apart (such
as on an infrequently-sampled airplane track), it will introduce
some error versus the great circle route an airplane normally
flies. A measure of the approximate accuracy of the GPS location
reading (based on the number of digits recorded in the track point)
is preserved when written into the image through the denominator of
rational value fields. A <strong class=
"userinput"><code>GPSDOP</code></strong> tag is also written for
exact point matches when satellite HDOP information is available,
providing a more dependable estimate of location accuracy.</p>
<p>The interpolation algorithm assumes that time values in GPX
files are strictly increasing, which is normally the case. If a GPX
file is found to violate this assumption, the message
<strong class="userinput"><code>Warning: track points are not
ordered by time</code></strong> is written so stderr along with the
first backwards-going time value. Any location values written to
images using such a file may not be using the best GPS coordinate
points available if the images were taken around the time of the
time incongruity. No warning is given if time between track
segments goes backwards, which would only affect correlations when
<strong class="userinput"><code>--ignore-tracksegs</code></strong>
is used. The <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--max-dist</code></strong> option can be used to
place a limit on how large a time gap is accepted, which can limit
the effect if this occurs.</p>
<p>GPX files often contain gaps in location coverage. Line of sight
to the GPS satellites can be lost if the receiver goes into a
tunnel or a dense forest, for example, and track recording will
stop until the connection can be reestablished. Some track
recorders will stop recording points if the receiver stops moving.
This results in points in the GPX file with timestamps far apart
from each rather, rather than only the normal one second apart (or
another short interval). The interpolation that <span class=
"command"><strong>gpscorrelate</strong></span> performs by default
assumes a smooth movement between the two known points on either
side, but if those two points are minutes or hours apart (or even
longer!) the interpolated position is unlikely to make sense. To
avoid ending up with a bad location for an image, the
<strong class="userinput"><code>--max-dist</code></strong> option
can be used to skip correlating photos that were taken within a
large gap in coverage.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<p>These programs follow the usual <acronym class=
"acronym">GNU</acronym> command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included
below.</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-g</code>, <code class=
"option">--gps</code> <em class=
"replaceable"><code>file.gpx</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Correlate images using the specified GPX file containing GPS
track points. This option can be given many times to specify
multiple GPX files. For each photo being correlated, the first file
containing a track covering the time the photo was taken will be
the one used. All <strong class=
"userinput"><code>&lt;trk&gt;</code></strong> segments in each file
are used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-l</code>, <code class=
"option">--latlong</code> <em class=
"replaceable"><code>latitude,longitude[,elevation]</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provide a specific geographic coordinate to use for all images
instead correlating along a path in a GPX file. The format must be
of the general form <strong class=
"userinput"><code>latitude,longitude,elevation</code></strong>
where latitude and longitude must each be in either decimal form,
such as <strong class="userinput"><code>-123.45678</code></strong>
or in degrees/minutes/seconds form, such as <strong class=
"userinput"><code>-123&deg;45'67.8"</code></strong> or
<strong class="userinput"><code>-123d45m67s</code></strong>.
Providing an elevation is optional. Each component can be separated
by commas, spaces or tabs.</p>
<p>Note that this option has a known limitation in that it does not
honour the locale's decimal place character in locales that use
other than ".".</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-s</code>, <code class=
"option">--show</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Only show the GPS data already in the given image's EXIF tags
instead of correlating them. The time shown comes directly from the
image without adjustments.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-x</code>, <code class=
"option">--show-gpx</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Only show the GPS data in the given images in GPX format. Note
that the points are written in the order in which the images are
found on the command-line, so be sure to give them in the order in
which they were photographed. The <code class=
"option">-z</code>/<code class="option">--timeadd</code> and
<code class="option">-O</code>/<code class=
"option">--photooffset</code> options are honoured just as in
correlation to determine the correct time zone of the images.
Images that can't be read or aren't GPS tagged are ignored. If the
times of the photos given on the command-line are not strictly
increasing, the message <strong class="userinput"><code>Warning:
image files are not ordered by time.</code></strong> is written to
stderr.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-o</code>, <code class=
"option">--machine</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Only show the GPS data of the given images in a machine-readable
CSV format. The time shown comes directly from the image without
adjustments. Images without GPS tags are ignored. The fields output
are file name, date and time, latitude, longitude, elevation, where
the first value is the filename, as passed, the second is the
timestamp, and the last three are floating point values with an
optional leading plus or minus.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-r</code>, <code class=
"option">--remove</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove all GPS EXIF data from the given images. Note that this
only removes the GPS tags that the program could add; it does not
delete all possible GPS EXIF tags. All other tags are left
alone.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-z</code>, <code class=
"option">--timeadd</code> <strong class=
"userinput"><code>+/-</code></strong><em class=
"replaceable"><code>HH</code></em>[<strong class=
"userinput"><code>:</code></strong><em class=
"replaceable"><code>MM</code></em>]</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Time to add to GPS points to make them match the timestamps of
the images. GPS timestamps are in UTC; image timestamps are
generally in local time. Enter the timezone used when taking the
images; e.g., <strong class="userinput"><code>+8</code></strong>
for Perth, Western Australia or <strong class=
"userinput"><code>-2:30</code></strong> for St. John's,
Newfoundland. This defaults to the time zone embedded in the image,
or if that is not available (or when <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--no-photo-tz</code></strong> is given), the UTC
offset of the local time zone as of the time of the first image
processed (versions before 1.7 defaulted to 00:00).</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class=
"option">--no-photo-tz</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Ignore any <strong class=
"userinput"><code>OffsetTimeOriginal</code></strong> EXIF tags in
photos that specify the time zone in which the photo was taken. If
the tag is wrong, such as if the user forgot to update the time
zone manually when travelling, then this will prevent it from being
used. If this option is given, then <span class=
"command"><strong>gpscorrelate</strong></span> reverts to using
automatic time zone detection for the photo, or a
manually-specified one (if <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--timeadd</code></strong> is given).</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-O</code>, <code class=
"option">--photooffset</code> <em class=
"replaceable"><code>seconds</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Time in seconds (fractional seconds are allowed) to add to the
photo timestamp to make it match the GPS timestamp. To determine
the number of seconds needed, just create a photograph of your GPS
device showing the current time and compare it with the timestamp
of your photo file. The EXIF time tags in the image are not
modified based on this value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-i</code>, <code class=
"option">--no-interpolation</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable linear interpolation between points. With this flag, the
nearest exact point (within <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--max-dist</code></strong>) is used. Without this
flag, photos taken between the time of two recorded GPS coordinates
are correlated based on linear interpolation between those two
points.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-v</code>, <code class=
"option">--verbose</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Show slightly more information during the image correlation
process, such as the GPS data selected for each image.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-d</code>, <code class=
"option">--datum</code> <em class=
"replaceable"><code>datum</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify GPS measurement datum. If not set, <strong class=
"userinput"><code>WGS-84</code></strong> is used (<strong class=
"userinput"><code>TOKYO</code></strong> is another possibility).
However, GPX is not supposed to store anything but WGS-84, so this
should only ever be needed with the <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--latlong</code></strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-n</code>, <code class=
"option">--no-write</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not write the correlated EXIF data back into the image.
Useful with <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--verbose</code></strong> to see what would
happen during image correlation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-R</code>, <code class=
"option">--replace</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Overwrite any existing GPS tags in the file. Without this
option, any file that already contains GPS tags will be
skipped.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-m</code>, <code class=
"option">--max-dist</code> <em class=
"replaceable"><code>time</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum time in seconds from the photo time which a logged GPS
point can refer and still be used for correlation. This defaults to
0, which means to disable this check. Only one of the two points
need be within this range for correlation to take place.</p>
<p>If a clear view of sufficient GPS satellites is lost while
recording a track, then there may be location gaps in the GPX file.
If the accuracy of the recorded location is paramount and you would
rather not correlate a position at all for a photo if the available
GPS coordinates were recorded too long ago in the past or too far
into the future (relative to when the photo was taken), then set
this to a nonzero value.</p>
<p>This option will also prevent recording heading and direction
under the same circumstances (see <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--max-heading</code></strong> for a discussion of
when this may be needed).</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-t</code>, <code class=
"option">--ignore-tracksegs</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Interpolate between track segments, too. Generally, track
segments show multiple sessions of GPS logging; between them is
generally when the GPS was not logging. Since interpolation honours
the <strong class="userinput"><code>--max-dist</code></strong>
flag, even track segments with wide time gaps can safely be used if
both flags are set. Without this flag, photos taken within the time
gap between two <strong class=
"userinput"><code>&lt;trkseg&gt;</code></strong> tracks in the GPX
file are not correlated.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class=
"option">--heading</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Write an EXIF tag showing the direction of movement at the time
of image capture. This is only possible if the direction is written
in an appropriate tag within a <code class=
"constant">&lt;trkpt&gt;</code> entry in the GPX file. Supported
tags are <code class="constant">course</code> (from GPX 1.0),
<code class="constant">extensions/TrackPointExtension/course</code>
(a <span class="trademark">Garmin</span>&REG; <code class=
"constant">TrackPointExtension</code>), and <code class=
"constant">extensions/compass</code> (written by <span class=
"productname">OSMTracker</span>&bull;).</p>
<p><span class="command"><strong>gpscorrelate</strong></span>
treats each of these tags as holding the true direction of
movement, but they aren't very well defined and might not hold
exactly what's expected. For example, a phone might store the
direction it's facing rather than the direction of movement, or the
direction might be the magnetic heading instead of true heading.
Or, a device might estimate the heading from GPS movement which
will be inaccurate at slow speeds. Use your knowledge of the
recording application to determine how much faith you can place in
the resulting tags.</p>
<p>If this is used with <code class="option">--latlong</code>
instead of with <code class="option">--gps</code>, then a fixed
heading of 0 is written (this is subject to change in the
future).</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-B</code>, <code class=
"option">--max-heading</code> <em class=
"replaceable"><code>degrees</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Don't write the tags for <code class="option">--heading</code>
and <code class="option">--direction</code> for images where the
heading has changed by more than the specified number of degrees
between the GPX points being used. This prevents writing a value
that is likely to be inaccurate because the image was taken during
a sharp turn. This is off by default.</p>
<p>This option won't prevent writing an incorrect heading or
direction in the case where GPS points are sparser than the time it
takes the recording vehicle to make a nearly 360&deg; turn. For
example, if the vehicle takes 8 seconds to turn completely around
but GPS tags are written every 10 seconds, then the two points
written at either end of the turn could have headings that are very
close (within <code class="option">--max-heading</code>) yet a
picture taken in the middle of the turn, 4 seconds after the first
tag, would have an interpolated heading that is around 180&deg; off
the correct value. Prevent this kind of bad value from being
written by setting a <code class="option">--max-dist</code> that is
much less than the time it takes to turn around, such as 4 in this
example.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-b</code>, <code class=
"option">--direction</code> <em class=
"replaceable"><code>degrees</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>write an EXIF tag showing the direction the camera was pointing
when the image was taken. The degrees argument gives the offset
between the direction of travel (the value that would be written if
<code class="option">--heading</code> were given) and the camera
direction. For example, if the camera is mounted pointing out the
right side window of a car then this would be specified as
<code class="option">--direction</code> <em class=
"replaceable"><code>90</code></em>. If <code class=
"option">--heading</code> is also given, then the two tags will
always be this number of degrees apart. If accuracy is important,
use the <code class="option">--max-heading</code> and <code class=
"option">--max-dist</code> options to limit writing these tags to
times when there is a good fix on the position and not during a
sharp turn. Since this option applies along the entire track, it's
only generally useful when the camera is fixed in the vehicle
during the trip.</p>
<p>This may be used with <code class="option">--latlong</code> in
which case the argument is used as the camera direction without
alteration.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-M</code>, <code class=

<dd>
<p>Do not change the last modification time of changed files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-f</code>, <code class=

<dd>
<p>Fix broken GPS datestamps written with <span class=
"command"><strong>gpscorrelate</strong></span> versions &lt; 1.5.2
by replacing them with the photo's time stamp. Prior to 1.5.2, two
bugs wrote the wrong value for the GPSDateStamp and GPSTimeStamp
tags. This option will check each supplied filename for the problem
and correct it. Use with <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--no-write</code></strong> to prevent writing
these changes (useful for checking for the issue). This option also
implies <strong class="userinput"><code>--no-mtime</code></strong>.
You will also need to use <strong class=
"userinput"><code>--timeadd</code></strong> to specify the
difference between localtime and UTC time for the supplied
photos.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class=

<p>Write location as DD MM.MM (instead of the more accurate DD MM
SS.SS) as was the default in <span class=

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>Correlate all photos in a directory taken in western Europe in
the summer (i.e., UTC-2):</p>

-g Test.gpx *.jpg</code></strong></p>
<p>Correlate all photos in a directory from a track spread out over
two different track files and taken in the computer's current time
zone, interpolating between segments and between files while

*.jpg</code></strong></p>
<p>Correlate a set of photos taken with a camera aimed straight out
of the right-hand passenger side window of a car (90&deg; from
straight ahead), using a GPX file containing direction tags,
skipping direction tagging during fast turns and all tags when a
GPS lock is lost for more than 6 seconds (to avoid writing
inaccurate tags):</p>

the clock was 77.5 seconds ahead of GPS time) and with
incorrectly-specified time zone tags:</p>
<p><strong class="userinput"><code>gpscorrelate -g Test.gpx -O
-77.5 --no-photo-tz photo.jpg</code></strong></p>

photo.jpg</code></strong></p>
<p>Create a GPX track from a set of images taken in the UK in
winter that are already GPS tagged (e.g., as might come from a cell
