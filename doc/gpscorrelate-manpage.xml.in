    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>This manual page documents the <command>&dhpackage;</command>
    command.
    There is extended documentation available in HTML format; see below.</para>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> is a program that acts on digital images
      in JPEG format, filling in the EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) fields
      related to GPS (Global Positioning System) information.  Source for the
      GPS data is a GPX (GPS Exchange Format) file, which records GPS location
      information in an XML-based format. The act of filling those fields is
      referred to as <emphasis>correlation</emphasis>.</para>

    <para> If GPS data are available at the precise moment the image was taken
      (with a 1-second granularity) the GPS data are stored unmodified in EXIF
      fields. If they are not, linear interpolation of GPS data available at
      moments before and after the image was taken can be used. If the image
      contains sub-second time resolution, it is used to obtain a more accurate
      estimate of the position between the two points. Linear interpolation
      gives good results when points are close together, but if they are several
      kilometres apart (such as on an infrequently-sampled airplane track), it
      will introduce some error versus the great circle route an airplane
      normally flies. A measure of the approximate accuracy of the GPS location
      reading (based on the number of digits recorded in the track point) is
      preserved when written into the image through the denominator
      of rational value fields. A <userinput>GPSDOP</userinput> tag is also
      written for exact point matches when satellite HDOP information is
      available, providing a more dependable estimate of location accuracy.
    </para>

    <para>
      The interpolation algorithm assumes that time values in GPX files are
      strictly increasing, which is normally the case. If a GPX file is found
      to violate this assumption, the message <userinput>Warning: track points
      are not ordered by time</userinput> is written so stderr along
      with the first backwards-going time value. Any location values written
      to images using such a file may not be using the best GPS coordinate
      points available if the images were taken around the time of the time
      incongruity.  No warning is given if time between track segments goes
      backwards, which would only affect correlations when
      <userinput>--ignore-tracksegs</userinput> is used.
      The <userinput>--max-dist</userinput> option can be used to place a limit
      on how large a time gap is accepted, which can limit the effect if this
      occurs.
    </para>

    <para>
      GPX files often contain gaps in location coverage. Line of sight to the
      GPS satellites can be lost if the receiver goes into a tunnel or a
      dense forest, for example, and track recording will stop until the
      connection can be reestablished. Some track recorders will stop recording
      points if the receiver stops moving. This results in points in the GPX
      file with timestamps far apart from each rather, rather than only the
      normal one second apart (or another short interval). The interpolation
      that <command>gpscorrelate</command> performs by default assumes a smooth
      movement between the two known points on either side, but if those
      two points are minutes or hours apart (or even longer!) the
      interpolated position is unlikely to make sense. To avoid ending up
      with a bad location for an image, the <userinput>--max-dist</userinput>
      option can be used to skip correlating photos that were taken within a
      large gap in coverage.

    <title>OPTIONS</title>

    <para>These programs follow the usual &gnu; command line syntax, with long
      options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included
      below.</para>

    <variablelist>

        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Correlate images using the specified GPX file containing
          GPS track points.  This option can be given many times to
          specify multiple GPX files.  For each photo being correlated,
          the first file containing a track covering the time the photo
          was taken will be the one used. All
          <userinput>&lt;trk&gt;</userinput> segments in each file are
          used. </para>
        </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <option>-l</option>,
          <option>--latlong</option>
          <replaceable>latitude,longitude[,elevation]</replaceable>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Provide a specific geographic coordinate to use for all images
            instead correlating along a path in a GPX file. The format must be
            of the general form
            <userinput>latitude,longitude,elevation</userinput> where latitude
            and longitude must each be in either decimal form, such as
            <userinput>-123.45678</userinput> or in degrees/minutes/seconds
            form, such as <userinput>-123°45'67.8"</userinput> or
            <userinput>-123d45m67s</userinput>. Providing an elevation is
            optional. Each component can be separated by commas, spaces or tabs.
          </para>
          <para>Note that this option has a known limitation in that it does not
            honour the locale's decimal place character in locales that use
            other than ".".

        <listitem>
          <para>Only show the GPS data already in the given image's EXIF tags
          instead of correlating them. The time shown comes directly from
          the image without adjustments.</para>

          <option>-x</option>,
          <option>--show-gpx</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Only show the GPS data in the given images in GPX format.
           Note that the points are written in the order in which the images
           are found on the command-line, so be sure to give them in the order
           in which they were photographed. The
           <option>-z</option>/<option>--timeadd</option> and
           <option>-O</option>/<option>--photooffset</option> options are
           honoured just as in correlation to determine the correct time zone
           of the images. Images that can't be read or aren't GPS tagged are
           ignored. If the times of the photos given on the command-line are not
           strictly increasing, the message <userinput>Warning: image files are
           not ordered by time.</userinput> is written to stderr.

          machine-readable CSV format. The time shown comes directly from the
          image without adjustments.  Images without GPS tags are
          ignored. The fields output are file name, date and time, latitude,
          longitude, elevation, where the first value is the filename, as
          passed, the second is the timestamp, and the last three are floating
          point values with an optional leading plus or minus.</para>

            <userinput>+8</userinput> for Perth, Western Australia or
            <userinput>-2:30</userinput> for St. John's, Newfoundland.
            This defaults to the time zone embedded in the image, or if that is not
            available (or when <userinput>--no-photo-tz</userinput> is given), the
            UTC offset of the local time zone as of the time of the first image
            processed (versions before 1.7 defaulted to 00:00).</para>

            If the tag is wrong, such as if the user forgot to update the time
            zone manually when travelling, then this will prevent it from being
            used. If this option is given, then <command>gpscorrelate</command>
            reverts to using automatic time zone detection for the photo, or
            a manually-specified one (if <userinput>--timeadd</userinput> is
            given).

          <para> If a clear view of sufficient GPS satellites is lost while
          recording a track, then there may be location gaps in the GPX
          file. If the accuracy of the recorded location is paramount and you
          would rather not correlate a position at all for a photo if
          the available GPS coordinates were recorded too long ago in the
          past or too far into the future (relative to when the photo
          was taken), then set this to a nonzero value.</para>
          <para> This option will also prevent recording heading and
          direction under the same circumstances (see
          <userinput>--max-heading</userinput> for a discussion of when this
          may be needed).

          safely be used if both flags are set.  Without this

        <listitem>
          <para>Write an EXIF tag showing the direction of movement at the time
          of image capture. This is only possible if the direction is written
          in an appropriate tag within a <constant>&lt;trkpt&gt;</constant> entry
          in the GPX file. Supported tags are <constant>course</constant>
          (from GPX 1.0), <constant>extensions/TrackPointExtension/course</constant>
          (a <trademark class='registered'>Garmin</trademark>

          </para>
          <para><command>gpscorrelate</command> treats each of these tags as holding
          the true direction of movement, but they aren't very well defined and might
          not hold exactly what's expected. For example, a phone might store the
          direction it's facing rather than the direction of movement, or the
          direction might be the magnetic heading instead of true heading. Or, a
          device might estimate the heading from GPS movement which will be
          inaccurate at slow speeds. Use your knowledge of the recording application
          to determine how much faith you can place in the resulting tags.
        </para>
        <para>If this is used with <option>--latlong</option> instead of with
          <option>--gps</option>, then a fixed heading of 0 is written (this is

          <option>--direction</option> for images where the heading has
          changed by more than the specified number of degrees between the GPX
          points being used.  This prevents writing a value that is likely to be
          inaccurate because the image was taken during a sharp turn. This
          is off by default.
          </para>
          <para>This option won't prevent writing an incorrect heading or
          direction in the case where GPS points are sparser than the time it
          takes the recording vehicle to make a nearly 360&deg;
          turn. For example, if the vehicle takes 8 seconds to turn
          completely around but GPS tags are written every 10 seconds,
          then the two points written at either end of the
          turn could have headings that are very close (within
          <option>--max-heading</option>) yet a picture taken in the
          middle of the turn, 4 seconds after the first tag,
          would have an interpolated heading that is around 180&deg;
          off the correct value. Prevent this kind of bad value from
          being written by setting a <option>--max-dist</option> that
          is much less than the time it takes to turn around, such as
          4 in this example.

          <para>write an EXIF tag showing the direction the camera was pointing
          when the image was taken. The degrees argument gives the offset
          between the direction of travel (the value that would be written if
          <option>--heading</option> were given) and the camera direction. For
          example, if the camera is mounted pointing out the right side window
          of a car then this would be specified as <option>--direction</option>
          <replaceable>90</replaceable>. If <option>--heading</option> is
          also given, then the two tags will always be this number of degrees
          apart. If accuracy is important, use the
          <option>--max-heading</option> and <option>--max-dist</option>
          options to limit writing these tags to times when there is a good fix
          on the position and not during a sharp turn.  Since this option
          applies along the entire track, it's only generally useful when the
          camera is fixed in the vehicle during the trip.
